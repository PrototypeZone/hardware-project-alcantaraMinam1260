## 1.0 Sparkfun Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor PI CENG-317 Project   

This is a build instruction for a Pi Soil Moisture Sensor project. It uses Sparkfunâ€™s SEN-17731 Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor. Connected to a Raspberry Pi. This project will let the user measure the moisture levels for their potted plant/garden.  

__Specifications__

--*I2C address: (0x28)

--*Dimensions: 20.3x 100.0mm

## 2.0 Added functionality

### 2.1 Sensor/Effector purchase   

Sensor:
SparkFun Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17731

Bill of Materials for the other Project Items: 
https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/bom.md

### 2.2 PCB design and soldering   

__PCB Creation__

1) Use KiCad

2) Launch KiCad and Start with default Settings

3) Download the below files:

[Project File](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/pcb/MiNamAlcantaraKiCad.kicad_pro)

[Schematic File](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/pcb/MiNamAlcantaraKiCad.kicad_sch)

[PCB File](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/pcb/MiNamAlcantaraKiCad.kicad_pcb)

4) Use KiCad to open the Project File

5) Edit the text of my name, and replace it with yours, and the date to the current date

6) Save Project As with your name and date

7) Use File->fabrication outputs->Gerbers (.gbr) and Plot the Gerbers

8) "Generate Drill Files"->PTH and NPTH in a single file

9) Save Project As with your name and date

10) Save it to a zip file

11) Print

__PCB Soldering__

Solder the PCB like below. Solder the resistors (220 ohm, 2.2k ohm), transistor (2N4124 PNP) and led (5mm LED). And solder the needed copper lines to the matching stacking header. __Perform a continuity test after soldering__.It follows the same layout as the KiCad PCB above.

### 2.3 Case design and assembly   

__Case Design & Assembly__

1) Download the cdr file

2) Save as PDF

3) Print and Laser Cut the board

4) Unscrew the Rasberry Pi Shell if you have the shell on

5) Insert the M2.5 screw in to the 4 PI holes put the printed matching donut holes on top.

![screw](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/media/screw.JPG)

6) Insert the 16mm Standoff above

7) Place the PCB with the connected stacking header on top of the GPIO and 16mm Standoff respectively

8) Should look like below:

![standoff-header](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/media/standoff-header.JPG)

9) Plug the sensor the the Qwiic cables and plug it to the PCB Qwiic Outlet.

10) Finished Product should look like:
