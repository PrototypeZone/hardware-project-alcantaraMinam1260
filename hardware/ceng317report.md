## 1.0 Sparkfun Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor PI CENG-317 Project   

This is a build instruction for a Pi Soil Moisture Sensor project. It uses Sparkfunâ€™s SEN-17731 Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor. Connected to a Raspberry Pi. This project will let the user measure the moisture levels for their potted plant/garden.

### 2.1 Sensor/Effector purchase   

Sensor:
SparkFun Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17731

Bill of Materials for the other Project Items: 
https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/bom.md

### 2.2 PCB design and soldering   

**PCB Creation**

1) Use KiCad

2) Launch KiCad and Start with default Settings

3) Download the below files:

Project File - https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/pcb/MiNamAlcantaraKiCad.kicad_pro

Schematic File - https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/pcb/MiNamAlcantaraKiCad.kicad_sch

PCB File - https://github.com/PrototypeZone/hardware-project-alcantaraMinam1260/blob/main/hardware/pcb/MiNamAlcantaraKiCad.kicad_pcb

4) Use KiCad to open the Project File

5) Edit the text of my name, and replace it with yours, and the date to the current date

6) Save Project As with your name and date

7) Use File->fabrication outputs->Gerbers (.gbr) and Plot the Gerbers

8) "Generate Drill Files"->PTH and NPTH in a single file

9) Save Project As with your name and date

10) Save it to a zip file

11) Print

**PCB Soldering**

Solder the PCB like below. Solder the resistors (220 ohm, 2.2k ohm), transistor (2N4124 PNP) and led (5mm LED). It follows the same layout as the KiCad PCB above.
